Mobile Application for CS153

After tearing my ACL, I had to start physical therapy. Often I am midway in a set and I always forget what rep I am at, so I made this app that will help me keep track. I need to eat on a better diet too, so I took the mealsDB api and specified the category for options so that I can also use this app to find good meals I can have after workouts! 

I plan to make it more extensive and continue to add my excerises, but hopefully in an easier way of not having to go to the code and manually fix everythng because that is a lot of work! It also needs a timer for the exercises that do not count based on amount done but of time.
