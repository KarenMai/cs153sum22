Mobile Application for CS153

After tearing my ACL, I had to start physical therapy. Often I am midway in a set and I always forget what rep I am at, so I made this app that will help me keep track. I need to eat on a better diet too, so I took the mealsDB api and specified the category for options so that I can also use this app to find good meals I can have after workouts!
